# P25NX_v2 Software

P25NX2 is a program that let you connect your Quantar repeater or DIU 3000 to multiple HAM networks as P25NX, P25Link, and P25-MMDVM. It use the v.24 port on Quantar/DIU 3000, a Cisco router 28xx and a Raspberry Pi.

To configure your Cisco router, please follow the P25NX router setup. If you only want to connect to P25-MMDVM, you only need to setup STUN.

To use the p25nx2 program copy files to your Raspberry path /opt/p25nx2.

To run the configuration menu:

cd /opt/p25nx2
sudo chmod 755 p25nx2-menu
sudo ./p25nx2-menu

there you can make the initial setup, download libraries to get it working, etc.

Mode = 0 means use of Serial (using Quantar_P25Link board still on development/test).

Mode = 1 means use of Cisco router and its STUN protocol.
